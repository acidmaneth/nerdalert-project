   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Interaction
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:80/prompt' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the latest Marvel movie updates?"
    }

### ✨ Stable Build & Streaming UX Polish
- Main chat bubble now only shows content after the last </think> tag, preserving all formatting and markdown.
- "Thinking"/internal agent thoughts are never shown in the main chat bubble, only in the collapsible "Show Thinking" section.
- The "THINKING..." animation is shown while the agent is still thinking, and the main answer appears as soon as it starts streaming in.
- The welcome/intro message is always shown in full, with all formatting preserved.
- This is the **current stable build** and recommended for production use.
