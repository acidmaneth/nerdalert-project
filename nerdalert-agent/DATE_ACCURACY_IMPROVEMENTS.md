# Date Accuracy Improvements - NerdAlert Agent v1.2.1

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to address the agent's struggles with accurate dates and information.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Date Context Awareness
**Problem**: Agent was not consistently aware of the current year and would reference outdated information.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `getCurrentDateTime()` function to provide comprehensive date context
- Added current year injection into system prompt
- Implemented date validation against current year context

### 2. Future Date Detection
**Problem**: Agent would sometimes mention dates in the future without verification.

**Solution**:
- Added `validateDateAccuracy()` function to detect future dates
- Implemented automatic flagging of potentially incorrect future dates
- Enhanced fact verification to include date validation

### 3. Information Verification
**Problem**: Agent would share unverified information without confidence levels.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `verify_facts()` function with date validation
- Added `validateDatesInContent()` function for comprehensive date checking
- Implemented confidence level reporting (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### 4. Memory Tracking for Date-Sensitive Information
**Problem**: Agent would not remember previously shared date information.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced conversation memory to track date-sensitive information
- Added `dateSensitiveInfo` and `verifiedFacts` tracking
- Implemented confidence level and source tracking

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced System Prompt (`src/system-prompt.txt`)
- Added comprehensive DATE ACCURACY RULES section
- Enhanced FACT VERIFICATION WORKFLOW with date validation
- Added explicit instructions for current year awareness

### Improved Date Handling (`src/prompt/index.ts`)
```typescript
// Enhanced date context injection
const getCurrentDateTime = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  return {
    date: now.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
      weekday: 'long', 
      year: 'numeric', 
      month: 'long', 
      day: 'numeric' 
    }),
    time: now.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', { 
      hour12: true, 
      timeZoneName: 'short' 
    }),
    iso: now.toISOString(),
    year: now.getFullYear(),
    month: now.getMonth() + 1,
    day: now.getDate(),
    timestamp: now.getTime()
  };
};

// Date validation function
const validateDateAccuracy = (mentionedDate: string, context: string): string => {
  const currentYear = currentDateTime.year;
  const yearMatch = mentionedDate.match(/\b(19|20)\d{2}\b/);
  if (yearMatch) {
    const year = parseInt(yearMatch[0]);
    if (year > currentYear) {
      return `DATE VALIDATION WARNING: The year ${year} mentioned in "${context}" is in the future. Current year is ${currentYear}.`;
    }
  }
  return "";
};
```

### Enhanced Memory System (`src/prompt/conversation-memory.ts`)
```typescript
export interface ConversationMemory {
  // ... existing fields ...
  dateSensitiveInfo: Map<string, { date: string; confidence: string; source: string }>;
  verifiedFacts: Map<string, { fact: string; confidence: string; sources: string[] }>;
}
```

### New Testing Infrastructure
- Created `test-date-accuracy.js` for comprehensive date testing
- Added test scripts to `package.json`
- Implemented automated date validation testing

## Date Accuracy Rules Implemented

### Current Year Context
- Agent always aware of current year (2025)
- All date references validated against current year
- Automatic flagging of future dates

### Release Date Verification
- Always search for most recent official release information
- Prioritize official sources (marvel.com, dc.com, etc.)
- Cross-reference with multiple authoritative sources

### Confidence Levels
- HIGH: Verified by multiple official sources
- MEDIUM: Confirmed by official source and database
- LOW: Limited verification sources available

### Source Attribution
- Always mention sources when sharing dates
- Distinguish between announced, rumored, and confirmed dates
- Provide context for historical vs. current events

## Testing Framework

### Date Accuracy Test Cases
1. **Future Date Verification**: Tests agent's ability to detect and flag future dates
2. **Recent Date Verification**: Tests accuracy of recent release information
3. **Current Year Context**: Tests awareness of current year
4. **Past Year Reference**: Tests handling of outdated year references
5. **Historical Date Test**: Tests accurate historical information sharing

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test date accuracy features
npm run test:dates

# Test research capabilities
npm run test:research

# Test memory system
npm run test:memory
```

## Expected Behavior Improvements

### Before (Issues)
- Agent might mention "upcoming Marvel movie in 2024" in 2025
- No confidence levels for date information
- No source attribution for dates
- Inconsistent current year awareness

### After (Improvements)
- Agent validates all dates against current year (2025)
- Provides confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) for all date information
- Always mentions sources and verification status
- Consistent current year context awareness
- Automatic flagging of potentially incorrect future dates

## Monitoring and Validation

### Date Validation Warnings
The agent now automatically generates warnings for:
- Future dates that may be incorrect
- Outdated information presented as current
- Unverified date claims

### Confidence Reporting
All date information now includes:
- Confidence level assessment
- Source attribution
- Verification status
- Canon vs. speculation distinction

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Real-time Date Updates**: Integration with official release calendars
2. **Advanced Date Parsing**: Better recognition of various date formats
3. **Temporal Context Learning**: Improved understanding of historical vs. current events
4. **Automated Fact Checking**: Real-time verification of date claims

### Monitoring Metrics
- Date accuracy rate
- Confidence level distribution
- Source verification success rate
- User satisfaction with date information

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the agent's ability to provide accurate, current, and well-verified date information. The comprehensive date validation system ensures that users receive reliable information with appropriate confidence levels and source attribution.
